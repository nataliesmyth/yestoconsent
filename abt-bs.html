She also received training as a a sexuality educator from the Masakhane Center in Newark, NJ where she taught sex ed to middle and high school students. She leads workshops on a variety of topics at colleges around the country and national conferences. One of her favorite workshops to present is on fatphobia and body liberation, which she has facilitated at a variety of locations, including the National Sex Ed Conference, Temple University, and Harvard University. Isy also facilitates trainings for parents on how to talk to their children about sexuality in such locations as the Trans Wellness Conference and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).  For Isy, sexuality education is social justice; she does this work because every child has the right to grow up with respect, bodily autonomy, high self-esteem, and accurate information.</p> <a href="#" class="fa fa-facebook"></a> <a href="#" class="fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a>
