        <p>Thank you so much for your interest in supporting YES!. By donating through any method listed below, you allow us to reach more people with intersectional sexuality education. More specifically, your generous support helps YES! compensate our administrative staff, workshop facilitators, podcast hosts, editors, and guests, as well as cover a host of other expenditures that make it possible for YES! to expand participants' understanding of sexuality and provide them with tools to be more communicative, respectful, and safe.</p>

        <ul><h2 class="abt-li-title">Examples of our current work, made possible by donations, include</h2>

With the help of special guests, Rebecca and Isy discuss their own experiences with these questions and explore how to address these topics with the young people in your lives.
