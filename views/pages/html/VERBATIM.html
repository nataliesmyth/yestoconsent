	<h2>It Started at 13</h2>
	<h6> March 25, 2019 | anonymous </h6>

	<a href="#"><img src="images/VERBATIM_rape_culture.jpg"></a>
	

	<p>When I was 13 it started. <br>


I was walking down the street and a man honked at me from his car and whistled.<br>

 

When I was 15 a man approached me in Penn Station.<br>

He asked me if I had ever worked in “the industry.” I said I had not. He asked me if I would be interested in working in “the industry.” I said I would not. He gave me his business card and, thankfully, he left. I believe he was a pimp and, as indicated by his business card, wanted me to work in porn.<br>

 

When I was 16 a man filmed me on the Subway.<br>

As soon as I realized I got up and left but I can only imagine what he did with that tape.<br>

 

Two weeks ago I was walking with some friends when three men started shouting at us.<br>

They told us that we were hot and aggressively tried to sell us drugs. We stubbornly did not acknowledge them but they followed us for 5 blocks.<br>

 

These are only a few of the instances men have sexually harassed me in public.<br>

 

It is not okay.<br>

 

It is never okay.<br>

 

This is rape culture and it needs to be stopped.</p>
